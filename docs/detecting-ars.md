# Detecting ARS

It can be difficult to detect whether a software engineer or software team will
write adaptive resilient software. One practice that may be helpful is to review
their processes and compare it with the practical development methods for
building adaptive resilient software.

In many situations, a development shop will not be practicing all of the
recommended processes suggested. These situations do not necessarily conclude
the software team failed to build adaptive resilient software. Regardless of the
specific processes, you should look for a team that creates flexible,
maintainable, scalable, and transparent software. Ultimately it is up to you to
determine what procedures are essential and choose the team that best matches
your goals.

Once you choose a team, it will be much easier to determine how they operate.
You should first look for transparency in the software team. If the team is not
transparent, it will be difficult to know if they are building flexible,
maintainable, and scalable software. If the team is transparent, you will want
to make sure the team gives thought to what happens when they are out of the
picture.
