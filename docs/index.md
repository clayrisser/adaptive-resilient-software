# Introduction

Traditionally, resilient software is software that can recoil from failure
quickly. We will define adaptive resilient software as **software that can recoil
from transition quickly**. A transition can occur negatively as vicissitude, but
often it happens as a result of progressive evolution.

A common vicissitude is the inevitable departure of a software engineer or
software team. It is easy for software engineers to focus on the current
objective and fail to prepare the software for when they leave. This failure
is a result of few incentives to give thought towards the future of the
software. In fact, often there are more incentives to develop software that is
not adaptive. Software that is dependent on a few engineers is a form of job
security. Purposefully writing nonadaptive software happens more frequently than
software engineers will admit.

Not all transitions are negative. Companies often pivot their strategies which
can result in significant software transformation. Planning for such shifts are
often overlooked by software engineers. In summary, writing nonadaptive software
will naturally occur unless processes are put in place to prevent it.

Many large corporations have processes to encourage adaptive resilient software.
However, they have a strong incentive to do so. The most significant culprit
that fails to write adaptive resilient software is development shops because
they do not bear the consequences of nonadaptive software.

The first section of this paper will cover some practical methods to build
adaptive resilient software. The next section will cover some practical open
source tools for implementing adaptive resilient software. The last section will
give some tips for detecting whether a software engineer or development shop is
writing adaptive resilient software.
